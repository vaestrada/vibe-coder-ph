## I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force across multiple industries, including software development, education, research, creative media, healthcare, and business. The increasing accessibility of AI tools, generative models, and so-called *vibe coding* practices (natural language–driven development) has enabled students, professionals, and independent creators to actively build and experiment with AI-powered solutions.

Despite the rapid adoption of AI technologies, there remains a gap between academic research, industry practice, and grassroots innovation. There is a need for a platform that brings together researchers, practitioners, students, and organizations to exchange knowledge, share outputs, and explore AI-driven career pathways.

This proposed event aims to serve as a shared learning and community space within UP Diliman, fostering dialogue, collaboration, and innovation in the field of Artificial Intelligence. As the country’s national university, UP Diliman is uniquely positioned to convene discussions that bridge academic research, industry practice, and public interest in emerging technologies such as AI.

## II. OBJECTIVES

The proposed event seeks to achieve the following objectives:

- Provide foundational and applied understanding of Artificial Intelligence by exposing participants to current AI technologies, tools, and practices used in academia, industry, startups, and creative fields.
- Demystify AI-related career pathways by showcasing diverse professional roles and trajectories, including AI research, software and machine learning engineering, product development, education, and creative or interdisciplinary applications.
- Highlight Filipino leadership and contributions in AI by featuring practitioners, researchers, and builders who are actively shaping AI-driven solutions locally and globally.
- Encourage active learning and community participation through moderated open-sharing sessions where participants can present AI-assisted or AI-built projects, prototypes, or creative outputs.
- Foster collaboration between academe, industry, and the broader community by creating opportunities for dialogue, networking, and knowledge exchange within a university setting.
- Promote responsible and ethical engagement with AI technologies by situating discussions within the broader social, educational, and national development context.
