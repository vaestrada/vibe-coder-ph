### Stop manually typing your future.

Whether you’re a **coder**, **creative**, or **corporate hopeful** —  
the rules of work have already changed.

Artificial Intelligence isn’t “coming.”  
It’s already reviewing resumes, generating code, writing copy, editing videos, and reshaping entire industries.

**Gen AI to Z** is a one-day career and community forum that helps you understand:

- What AI *actually* does (beyond the hype)
- How people are **using it right now** in real jobs
- Where *you* fit in an AI-driven future

This isn’t about fear.  
It’s about **leverage**.

### What makes this different

- 🎓 University-led, community-driven  
- 🧠 Practical, not theoretical  
- 🇵🇭 Centered on Filipino builders, researchers, and creatives  
- 🛠 Focused on careers — not just tools  

**From “prompting” to “promoted.”**  
That’s the goal.

- A **career shifter** or early-career professional feeling left behind by tech  
- Someone asking: *“Where do I even start?”*

You don’t need to be an AI expert.  
You just need to be **curious**.

- ✔ Real examples of AI use across industries  
- ✔ Insight into how companies, startups, and creators work with AI

### Why now

AI is no longer a niche skill.  
It’s a **career multiplier**.

Those who understand how to work *with* it — not against it —  
will move faster, adapt better, and stay relevant longer.
